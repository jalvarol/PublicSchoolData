# PublicSchoolData
This repository contains a project that uses public school data and utilizes current tools to analyze student test scores to potentially find correlations. The data is from public records known as SARC, a School Accountability Report Card. These cards contain unique information such as students' test scores, socioeconomic statuses, and absentee rates.
