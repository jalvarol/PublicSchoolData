# PublicSchoolData
Utilized data analytical skills and toolsets such as Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze public school data. The project aimed to uncover potential links between community attributes and academic results in public schools across California. Collected and pre-processed data from public records, including School Accountability Report Cards (SARC), and employed various statistical methods to identify correlations between variables like absenteeism, socioeconomic status, and test scores. Key findings included a high correlation between absenteeism and lower test scores among socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The goal of this project is to raise awareness with concrete data and to annually revisit the updated data to monitor progress.
