# PublicSchoolData
This repository contains a project that uses public school data and utilizes current tools to analyze student test scores to potentially find correlations. The data is from public records that contain SARC, also known as a School Accountability Report Card. These cards contain unique information such as student test scores, socioeconomic status, absentee rate, and many others.
