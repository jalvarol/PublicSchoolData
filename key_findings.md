# Key Findings from Public School Data Analysis

## 1. Socioeconomic Status Impact
Schools with higher percentages of socioeconomically disadvantaged students show significantly lower test scores in both Math and English Language Arts.
- **Correlation values:** -0.76 to -0.84

## 2. Teacher Salary Relationship
Higher teacher salaries show a modest positive correlation with test scores. High-level teacher salaries correlate at approximately 0.18 with test scores, suggesting that competitive compensation may contribute to student achievement.

## 3. Chronic Absence Impact
Higher chronic absence rates strongly correlate with lower test scores.
- **Correlation values:** -0.39 to -0.48, indicating that regular attendance is an important factor in student achievement.

## 4. Salary Structure Observations
There's a strong correlation (0.72-0.76) between beginning, mid-career, and high-level teacher salaries, suggesting districts with higher starting salaries tend to maintain competitive compensation throughout career progression.

## 5. Absence Rate Patterns
Absence rates strongly correlate across different student groups (0.76-0.95), suggesting that absence issues tend to affect entire school populations rather than being isolated to specific demographic groups.
